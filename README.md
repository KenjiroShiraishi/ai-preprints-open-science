# 🧠 AI, Preprints, and Open Science  
**Learning, Teaching, and Applying Open Science: An Educational Model Using AI and Preprints**

---

## 🔍 Overview
This repository provides resources for exploring how Artificial Intelligence (AI), preprints, and open science can be integrated into education and academic practice.  
It offers tools, examples, and prompts that support ethical, transparent, and participatory science.

## ❓ Why This Matters
In an era where generative AI and preprints are becoming default tools for students and early-career researchers, understanding their ethical and practical implications is no longer optional—it's essential.

Soon, students will be more fluent in using AI tools than their supervisors. Preprints will become standard entry points to research visibility. If educators, reviewers, and senior researchers do not engage with these changes, a generational gap in epistemic authority will emerge.

These shifts are not just technological but cultural, redefining what it means to do science in a transparent and ethical way.
