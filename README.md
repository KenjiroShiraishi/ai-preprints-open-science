## ❓ Why This Matters / なぜこの教材が必要なのか？

In an era where generative AI and preprints are becoming default tools for students and early-career researchers, understanding their ethical and practical implications is no longer optional—it's essential.

Soon, students will be more fluent in using AI tools than their supervisors. Preprints will become standard entry points to research visibility. If educators, reviewers, and senior researchers do not engage with these changes, a **generational gap in epistemic authority** will emerge.

This repository aims to equip all learners—especially instructors—with tools, concepts, and real-world examples to:

- Understand the shifts in scientific authorship and communication
- Preserve intellectual responsibility in the age of AI
- Promote open, reproducible, and trustworthy science
